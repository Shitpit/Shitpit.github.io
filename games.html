    <h1> Games on the shitpit
        <br>
    </h1>
On the shitpit we offer a wide selection of games
some off these games are made by the team (overworked individual) at the shitpit
<br><br> However most of these games are games that I have handpicked for the fact that when 
playing you have the cognisance that you are enjoying yourself.
