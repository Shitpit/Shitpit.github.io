        <div>
                I create a <span style="font-family: monospace;"> code </span> that is a string of characters which determines
            where someone is up to in the language learning experience. ie. someone completes a lesson and gets given a code that unlocks a new lesson. for example a code could be: 
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">"LESSON=2&zazin%rand=7"</span> the random number is so the person can't just guess the code and get to the next lesson. the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">LESSON=</span> just shows what the player is up to and <span style="font-family: monospace;">"&zazin"</span> indicates the language

        </div>
        <br> this also allows for a developer cheat code such as <span style="font-family: monospace;">DEV%rand=2 </span> to unlock all lessons for debugging purposes
        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="font-size: 1.2360679775pc; color: hsl(349, 100%, 64%); font-weight: 800;"> Problems raised by this solution</div>
        <br>
        <br/>
        Humans like me have a hard time remembering the codes so to shorten down the code we can develop a syntax that allows for (unmanitory) consiseness for example 
        <div>you <span style="font-style: italic;"> could </span>type <span style="font-family: monospace;">"LESSON=2&zazin%rand=2"</span> but instead recommend using <span style="font-family: monospace;">"Le2azp2 / LESSON(e = equals)2(a = @)z(p = percent) 2"</span> so us humans can easily remember the code</div>

        <div style="font-size: 1.2360679775pc; color: hsl(349, 100%, 64%); font-weight: 800;"> On the topic of randomness </div>
        <br/>
        <div> due to cross compatibility reasons such as wanting to use these codes in the future without advanced computer generation the random number is the lesson number converted to the pi equivilent 1=3 2=1 3=4 and then 
            that gets turned into the a prime number for example lesson number one would be 5  (1 = 3 = 3rd prime number = 5) and lesson number 2 would be 2 (second digit of pi = 1, first prime number = 2) this is good for using this code or even making user generated language learning apps using this method  </div>
